A rudimentary application developed with two other computer science students and an arts & science student (the director) using React Native framework and Firebase as backend. The goal of this application is to be able to connect with other users across campus and be able to pitch ideas for new projects and meet up with similarly-minded individuals. Some features were lacking at this point due to time constraints, but basic functionality has been implemented. 

React Native was chosen because of its cross-platform portability (See this link for more details on React Native:  https://facebook.github.io/react-native/). 

Firebase was chosen for the backend because of the ease with which we could integrated into React Native. It also provided many useful features, such as signup, authentication, and real-time updating via the REST API, without having to hand-write the code.  

This framework's strengths were its simplicity and readability, and its ease of implementation. However, since it was a relatively new one, my teammates and I often ran into environment issues (React Native was updated three times over the course of this project). Some problems included issues with npm, having to delete caches, and reconfiguring environment variables and build paths several times.
