Attempting to fix errors with Git and React Native. Unable to install app in emulator after 
resolving (hopefully) the errors encountered when trying to run the master project when 
pulled from our remote repository. All of today was spent troubleshooting those errors, so 
not much progress was made in terms of meeting our goals. Hopefully we'll have resolved any
issues by next class.
